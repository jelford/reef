Documentation
-------------
This was a 3rd Year Project undertaken by students at Imperial College London. We have chosen to release the code under the GPLv3.
During the course of the project, various managerial documents were produced as part of the ongoing assessment process; these documents can be found under the `docs` directory of the repository. They are all in `.pdf` format, and are accompanied by staff feedback where given. Readers might note that all reports with feedback given were awarded `A` grades (with the highest possible being `A+`), so we hope these documents are useful. Please also find slides used for the end-of-project Oral presentation in the same directory under Presentation.
